## What is a port scanner ?
It is a program that checks a host or a sevrer for open ports.


## Features:-
1. Notifies you when a start starts
2. Multithreaded (Faster scans)
3. Scans ports from 1-1000 (customizable)

## Updates Planned:-
1. Export scan results to a txt file.
2. Add a GUI.

Thank you!
